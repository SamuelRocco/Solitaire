## How to Play

### How to Play Solitaire

Solitaire, also known as "Patience," is a popular single-player card game. The most common version is "Klondike" Solitaire. Here's how you play:

#### Setup
1. **Deck:** Use a standard 52-card deck.
2. **Tableau:** Deal seven piles of cards. The first pile has one card, the second has two, the third has three, and so on, up to the seventh pile, which has seven cards. Only the top card of each pile is face-up; the rest are face-down.
3. **Foundations:** Four empty spaces for each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) to be built from Ace to King.
4. **Stock:** The remaining cards form the stock pile.
5. **Waste:** Cards that cannot be played immediately are placed face-up in the waste pile.

#### Objective
- Move all the cards to the four foundation piles, sorted by suit and in ascending order from Ace to King.

#### Rules
1. **Building on the Tableau:**
   - Cards can be moved from one tableau pile to another in descending order and alternating colors (e.g., a red 9 can be placed on a black 10).
   - Only a King can be moved to an empty tableau space.
   - You can move sequences of cards as a unit (e.g., a red 7, black 6, red 5) if the sequence is in descending order and alternating colors.

2. **Exposing Hidden Cards:**
   - When you move a face-up card, you can turn over the face-down card beneath it.

3. **Moving Cards to Foundations:**
   - Cards are moved to the foundation piles in ascending order by suit (Ace to King).
   - Only an Ace can be placed on an empty foundation pile.

4. **Using the Stock:**
   - Draw cards from the stock pile one at a time or three at a time, depending on your chosen rules.
   - Cards from the stock that cannot be played immediately are placed in the waste pile.
   - You can go through the stock pile as many times as you like, depending on your chosen rules.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - You win by moving all cards to the foundation piles.

#### Tips
- Focus on exposing hidden cards in the tableau.
- Move cards to the foundations only when it benefits you (i.e., donâ€™t move a card if it prevents you from making a necessary move in the tableau).
- Try to create empty tableau spaces to move Kings into.
